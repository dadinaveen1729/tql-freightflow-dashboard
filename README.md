TQL FREIGHTFLOW DASHBOARD – BUILT BY DADI NAVEEN

What is this project?

This dashboard helps sales reps and brokers at TQL quickly see how their loads are performing. It highlights top clients, tracks issues like missed pickups, and shows which carriers are reliable. It’s built for fast, clear decision-making.

Why did I build this?

In logistics, every minute matters. I built this because I know TQL sales reps are managing 80+ calls a day, tracking dozens of shipments. This tool gives quick insights that help close deals faster, avoid repeat issues, and build trust with clients.

How it works:

I created a dataset of client loads and used Python and visualization tools to build charts that show:
- Total gross margin per client
- Which carriers are on time the most
- Which clients face the most pickup issues

These visuals give fast answers for smarter follow-ups and better bookings.

Dashboards Included:

1. Gross Margin by Client:
   Shows which clients bring the most revenue. Helps focus sales efforts on high-value accounts.

2. Carrier On-Time Pickup Rate:
   Visualizes which carriers show up on time the most. Good for picking the most reliable partners.

3. Pickup Issues by Client:
   Highlights where most problems happen. Great for follow-ups and saving accounts.

I built this project specifically with TQL in mind. It’s real, useful, and shows how I think about logistics problems — and how I turn them into solutions.

Let’s connect. I’m excited to bring this mindset to your team.
